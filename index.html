      <h2>Ulises Carrión - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</h2>
      <div class="date">January 21, 2025</div>
      <p>Ulises Carrión’s essay explains how Mail Art uses the postal system as a tool rather than the main focus. He criticizes how people often confuse Mail Art with making postcards, instead of seeing it as a way to rethink communication. Carrión describes the postal system as a “Big Monster,” representing the rules and limits of institutions, and views Mail Art as a way to challenge these restrictions. He emphasizes that the true value of Mail Art lies in its ability to connect people and provoke thought, not in the physical mail itself. This perspective raises questions about how art interacts with systems and whether similar ideas apply in the digital age.</p>

      <h2>Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</h2>
      <div class="date">January 22, 2025</div>
      <p>In her essay, Laurel Schwulst talks about the creative freedom that personal websites offer compared to corporate platforms. She describes websites as living spaces, like gardens or rooms, which grow and change over time. I found her comparison thought-provoking because it emphasizes the personal connection between creators and their digital spaces. Creators become both authors and architects, building worlds that evolve over time. Schwulst’s argument that websites can act as both a mirror and a tool for shaping identity made me reflect on how I use the web. Her ideas encourage us to think about how we can reclaim the internet as a more personal and meaningful space.</p>

      <h2>Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</h2>
      <div class="date">February 4, 2025</div>
      <p>Olia Lialina’s essay examines the rise and fall of Geocities, highlighting its significance as a space for early web users to express themselves. She explores how its shutdown erased a major part of internet history but also sparked efforts to archive and preserve its remains. I found it interesting how she describes Geocities as more than just a collection of amateur pages; it was a reflection of a more personal, decentralized internet. The essay raises important questions about digital permanence and who controls online spaces. It made me wonder how much of today’s internet will be lost in the future and whether we are doing enough to preserve digital culture.</p>

      <h2>Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</h2>
      <div class="date">February 9, 2025</div>
      <p>Alessandro Ludovico and Florian Cramer explore how print and digital media continue to evolve together rather than one replacing the other. They argue that digital publishing is not just about accessibility but also about networking and interactivity, while print remains valuable for its physical qualities and permanence. I found their discussion of DIY publishing and hybrid print-digital models compelling because it challenges the idea that print is outdated. Their vision of print as an interactive and customizable medium suggests that the future of publishing lies in blending both forms rather than treating them as opposing forces. This made me reflect on how I consume media and whether I value digital convenience more than the experience of print.</p>

      <h2>Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</h2>
      <div class="date">February 9, 2025</div>
      <p>Bojana Coklyat and Shannon Finnegan explore alt-text as both an accessibility tool and a creative practice. They challenge the idea that alt-text should be purely functional, instead encouraging writers to see it as a form of translation and even poetry. I found their argument compelling because it shifts the perception of alt-text from a technical requirement to a thoughtful act of inclusion. Their approach raises questions about subjectivity in description and the role of authorship in accessibility work. This made me consider how digital spaces could be more engaging and meaningful if accessibility were treated as an art rather than just an obligation.</p>

      <h2>Ramsey Nasser - "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</h2>
      <div class="date">February 26, 2025</div>
      <p>Ramsey Nasser critiques the dominance of the English language in computing and explores whether a truly multilingual programming experience is possible. He highlights how programming languages, software libraries, and even text rendering systems are deeply rooted in English, creating barriers for non-English speakers. I found his discussion of the Arabic programming language Qalb especially interesting because it exposes how non-English programming remains isolated from mainstream software development. Nasser argues that this linguistic bias limits accessibility and reinforces cultural hierarchies in technology. His essay made me question whether it is realistic, or even possible, to create a computing experience that does not depend on English.</p>

      <h2>David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design</h2>
      <div class="date">March 14, 2025</div>
      <p>David Reinfurt’s selections from A New Program for Graphic Design explore how Gestalt principles shape visual perception and how design relies on organizing discrete elements into meaningful wholes. He discusses how perception is not just about individual components but about the relationships between them, explaining how we naturally group visual information. I found it interesting how he connects these ideas to graphic design, showing how effective design depends on understanding how people see and interpret patterns. His discussion of perception as an active process made me think about how much designers influence what we notice and how we interpret visual information. This raises larger questions about whether good design should guide perception subtly or challenge viewers to see things in new ways.</p>

      <h2>Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</h2>
      <div class="date">March 30, 2025</div>
      <p>Dot Tuer’s essay explores Vera Frenkel’s String Games as a piece of new media art that blends technology, memory, and performance. Tuer shows how Frenkel used teleconferencing tools and the structure of Cat’s Cradle to create improvised, networked gestures between cities. I was struck by how the piece highlights absence—players act together across distance, but something is always missing in the transmission. Tuer argues that this loss becomes part of the artwork’s meaning, especially when viewed in light of Frenkel’s later works about exile and memory. It made me think about how digital communication can connect us while still reminding us of what’s lost.</p>

      <h2>Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed</h2>
      <div class="date">April 3, 2025</div>
      <p>Paul Soulellis explores how publishing has shifted from fixed, intentional acts like printing to the constant, flowing nature of digital feeds. He contrasts traditional “posts,” which are rooted in physical space and clear authorship, with live-streams and algorithmic content that blur boundaries between viewers, creators, and machines. I found his idea of the feed as both atmosphere and noise insightful—it captures how digital content now surrounds us without demanding full attention. His reflection on the need to interrupt or archive parts of the feed feels urgent in a world where information is endless and meaning can be lost. This made me think about how I interact with media and what it means to “publish” something today.</p>

      <h2>Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</h2>
      <div class="date">April 14, 2025</div>
      <p>Beyond Dark Matter tells a powerful story about the hidden systems behind technology, especially the way control shows up in everyday tools like computers. I appreciated how the narrative made these heavy themes more approachable by using the voice of a curious student and a familiar world. The cute and expressive art style stood out to me, it added warmth and personality to a story that talks about serious topics. I thought it was a creative and effective way to keep readers engaged while teaching about complex ideas. It also made me think about how community and care could be part of how we design and use technology.</p>

      <h2>Boris Groys - Art on the Internet</h2>
      <div class="date">April 20, 2025</div>
      <p>Boris Groys explains how the internet changes the way we make and view art by removing the separation between creation and exhibition. Art is no longer hidden away until it’s ready, instead, it’s shared in progress, and even the documentation becomes part of the work. I found his comparison of the internet to both a church and a place of control especially interesting, it allows constant visibility, which can feel either empowering or limiting. Groys also points out how online art loses some of its fictional nature because it appears next to real-world data, making it harder to separate imagination from fact. This made me think about how artists today navigate creativity while always being watched.</p>
